* Text classification is a very common problem that needs solving when dealing with text data.
* We’ve all seen and know how to use Encoder Transformer models like Bert and RoBerta for text classification but did you know you can use a Decoder Transformer model like GPT2 for text classification?
* In this tutorial, I will walk you through on how to use GPT2 from HuggingFace for text classification.
* We will start with downloading customized dataset, installing required componments, selecting pre-trained models, and then train the model. we will finally evaluate the results and how to optimize further.


**Duration:** *1 Hour 45 Minutes*

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: **[Slides](https://gmihaila.github.io/docs/markdown/activities/find_new_sentiment/slides.html){:target="_blank"}**

:calendar: **march 3, 2020** |
*University of North Texas DP F223*

* Using text embedding and clustering methods to find new sentiments in text data.
* Use imdb movie reviews dataset and see how positive-negative sentiments can be used to find other sentiments.
* Use Tensorflow 2, Word Embeddings, Contextual Embeddings.
* We'll do clustering and find best number of cluster in data we don't know anything about.
* We'll do pretty plots to interpret results!
* We'll do all this on our UNT Talon Supercomputer!

**Duration:** *1 Hour 15 Minutes*

:calendar: **may 3, 2019** |
*University of North Texas DP F285*

* How to use UNT HPC GitLab server
* Ever wondered what is Git and why every software company uses it? We'll teach some basic commands in Git Lab (platform used in almost every software company). And Yes, UNT has a Git Lab!

**Duration:** *1 Hour 15 Minutes*

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: **[Slides](https://gmihaila.github.io/docs/markdown/activities/talon_word_emb_intro/slides.html){:target="_blank"}**

:calendar: **may 2, 2019** |
*University of North Texas DP F223*

* Natural Language Processing on Talon HPC
* Ever wondered or curious about natural language processing? How do you load a text file, how do you 'clean' it, how do you make use of it? We will learn all that and at the end you will build a Neural Network model that can predict a sentiment of a Movie Review. All this on Talon!

**Duration:** *1 Hour 15 Minutes*

:calendar: **may 1, 2019** |
*University of North Texas DP F223*

* Hands on work on Talon UNT HPC
* This workshop will go over some basic instruction about Python and Jupyter Notebooks. We will learn how to see what libraries we have available and how to install your own.Learn how to create a virtual environment, and most exciting build a simple Neural Network model to predict diabetes! All this on Talon!
